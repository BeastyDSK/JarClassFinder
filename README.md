  If its showing the above error then the issue is you havnt read the line number 4. So if you have time please pls read or try googling. That might help!
  
I tried to fix all the issue(s) while testing so if you have any other issue please mention.


## New :
  Added Settings Menu. (Options -> Settings)
    1) You can now set the default jar path in the settings. So you dont have to browse the same path again and again.
    
    2) Added support to open JD-GUI if you double click on the jar (in search result). 
    
    **Important before that set the JD-GUI path.**
